---

### 🗓️ **Day 7 — Mock FAANG Drills + Review**

**Checklist**

- ✅ Can you implement Merge Sort & Quick Sort from memory?
    
- ✅ Do you know which algorithms are stable/adaptive?
    
- ✅ Can you apply sorting to solve non-sorting problems (intervals, meetings, etc.)?
    

**Drill Problems**

- 🔹 Leetcode #253 – Meeting Rooms II
    
- 🔹 Leetcode #56 – Merge Intervals (again)
    
- 🔹 Leetcode #1122 – Relative Sort Array
    

**Bonus**

- Study Timsort (Java / Python sort) internals
    
- Re-implement any two sorts without peeking at your old code
